A Typescript safe implementation of a GUID that allows for validation of the format while limiting boilerplate to reference the value itself.

Uses types not classes to be more lightweight / reusable

Allows users to parseGuid(val:string), parseExactGuid(val:string), or tryParseGuid(val:string) 
Gain the benefits of strict types with linters to prevent runtime bugs with Guids!
